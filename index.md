> Well-known defenses exist to detect and mitigate common faults and memory safety
vulnerabilities in software.  Yet, many of these mitigations do not address the
challenge of software _resilience_ and _availability_, i.e., whether a
system can continue to carry out its function and remain responsive, while being
under attack and subjected to malicious inputs.  

> We propose _secure rewind and discard of isolated domains_ as an efficient and secure
method of improving the resilience of software that is targeted by run-time
attacks.  In difference to established approaches, we rely on
compartmentalization instead of replication and checkpointing.  We show the
practicability of our methodology by realizing a software library for
Secure Domain Rewind and Discard SDRaD and demonstrate how SDRaD can be applied
to real-world software.
